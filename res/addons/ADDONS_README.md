# Addons

You can specify additional resources (scripts, sounds, etc) to load by using addons.
Addons are just folders with the same directory structure as `/res/`, minus the `addons` folder.

A directory structure for an addon named `example` might look like this:

```
📁 /res/addons
 └📁 example
   ├📁 scripts
   │ ├📁 agents
   │ │ └📄 operator.lua
   │ └📁 api
   │   └📄 utilities.lua
   ├📁 sounds
   │ └🔊 bigscream.wav
   └📁 soundbanks
```
